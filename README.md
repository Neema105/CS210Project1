Project 1 CS210 at SNHU



Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.


The project is meant to create a program that can convert a 12-hour clock to a 24-hour clock for an organization named Chada Tech. 

What did you do particularly well?


I believe one aspect of the program I excelled at were creating reusable functions that were effective and efficent. This allowed for the code in my main function to be much smaller in comparison.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

One enhancement I could make to improve my code would be to not use while(true) loops. This is bad programming practice and can lead to excessive memory usage. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

My initial confusion came from understanding how to have the program interpret AM from PM to convert to military time, but I was able to resolve this by watching youtube tutorials of similar projects. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

One skill from this project that will be transferable to other projects or course work is learning how to properly use comments to display the purpose of each block of code.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this program maintanable, readable, and adaptable through trial and error. When I first got the program to work the code was very sloppy and needed lots of formatting to meet proper coding standards. After a few revisions I was abole to create informative comments,
properly space out blocks of code, and remove excessive lines.
